# Bryan Helvey - GitHub Repository

Welcome to my (first) GitHub repository! This project demonstrates how I manage HPC job scripts, automation tools, and documentation. It's a lot of placeholders, really

## Contents
- `pbspro_jobs/`: Example job submission scripts for PBS workload manager
- `ansible/`: Ansible automation playbooks and inventories for system setup
- `docs/`: Documentation on usage and setup

## Goals
- Maintain reproducible, version-controlled HPC scripts
- Automation through Ansible
- Establish a GitHub presence
